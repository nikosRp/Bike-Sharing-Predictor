## Bike Sharing Predictor

## Project Overview

In this project, which is part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree project, we implement a Neural Network in order to predict bike rentals  



## Getting started

You can review the code and my asnwers for this project in the my_answers.py and in the Your_first_neural_network.ipynb file

You can also clone the original project and implement your own solution for this project from [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)

Or simply : 
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-bikesharing
```
	
## Prerequisites
You can see all the prerequisites needed in the requirements.txt file
Or you can install them using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I used Anaconda to create a virtual environment on Windows OS
You can check how to use Anaconda and virtual environments [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

Note that the file containts libraries (such as Pytorch) that are not needed for this project, but the will be used in future Deep Learning projects

Finally you will need the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) from UCI Machine Learning Database
